# How to set up a testing environment

Testing needs a running 'openwsmand' service which can connect
to a CIM broker.


sfcb (small footprint cim broker) is used as the CIM broker. It should
have the 'cmpi-base' CIM provider available.


## Authentication

It is assumed that a 'wsman' user exists with password 'secret'.

This user should be in the 'sfcb' group.


## Testing under (open)SUSE

zypper in sblim-sfcb
zypper in sblim-cmpi-base


Start sblim-sfcb

> sudo sfcbd


Start openwsmand

> sudo openwsmand -d

Run tests

> cd build
> make test
