// 2=On, corresponding to ACPI state G0 or S0 or D0. 
// 3=Sleep - Light, corresponding to ACPI state G1, S1/S2, or D1. 
// 4=Sleep - Deep, corresponding to ACPI state G1, S3, or D2.
// 5=Power Cycle (Off - Soft), corresponding to ACPI state G2, S5, or D3, but where the managed element is set to return to power state "On" at a pre-determined time. 
// 6=Off - Hard, corresponding to ACPI state G3, S5, or D3. 
// 7=Hibernate (Off - Soft), corresponding to ACPI state S4, where the state of the managed element is preserved and will be recovered upon powering on. 
// 8=Off - Soft, corresponding to ACPI state G2, S5, or D3. 
// 9= Power Cycle (Off-Hard), corresponds to the managed element reaching the ACPI state G3 followed by ACPI state S0. 
// 10=Master Bus Reset, corresponds to the system reaching ACPI state S5 followed by ACPI state S0. This is used to represent system master bus reset. 
// 11=Diagnostic Interrupt (NMI), corresponding to the system reaching ACPI state S5 followed by ACPI state S0. This is used to represent system non-maskable interrupt. 
// 12=Off - Soft Graceful, equivalent to Off Soft but preceded by a request to the managed element to perform an orderlyshutdown. 
// 13=Off - Hard Graceful, equivalent to Off Hard but preceded by a request to the managed element to perform an orderly shutdown.

// 15=Power Cycle (Off - Soft Graceful), equivalent to Power Cycle (Off - Soft) but preceded by a request to the managed element to perform an orderly shutdown. 
// 16=Power Cycle (Off - Hard Graceful), equivalent to Power Cycle (Off - Hard) but preceded by a request to the managed element to perform an orderly shutdown.
